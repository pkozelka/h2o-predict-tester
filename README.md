# H2O.ai Prediction Tester

This repository contains several sample H2O models trained for specific scenarios.

It also has a tooling to perform predictions, in order to have baseline for comparisons of changed or alternate implementations.


## Goals

- provide MOJOs for generic use, with relevant test data sets
- provide tooling to verify predictions
